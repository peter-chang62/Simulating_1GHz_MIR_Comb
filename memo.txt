I'll maybe directly edit PyNLO from Connor's branch, and then I'll eventually rename it from pynlo_connor to pynlo (use it as the main pynlo simulation package).

Connor already has a FromPowerSpectrum classmethod which allows you to set the spectrum using FROG data. 

Connor's model.py is more efficient than yours, he's using real rfft and irfft. You should implement the same! 

Most / all of the changes you need to make are on your own files not connor's...

you just finished renaming self.ind_pm_thz -> self.ind_ret, you still need to make sure that self.pulse is used correctly in the retrieval call.
